A Classification problem on imbalanced dataset by applying UnderSampling and OverSampling techniques.
We have identified that imbalanced data can cause overfitting which is removed by undersampling technique with improved performance. Oversampling helped to build the best possible model performance.

Prerequisites: 

Other than the regular Machine Learning/Deep Learning libraries, we need imblearn library for OverSampling Technique. To install please select any of the following:

pip install -U imbalanced-learn

conda install -c glemaitre imbalanced-learn
